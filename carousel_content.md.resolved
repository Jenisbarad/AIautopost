## POST 1: Google Gemini 3.1 Pro

**POST_TITLE:** Google Gemini 3.1 Pro

**SLIDE_1:**
Headline: Google Just Doubled Its AI Reasoning
Subtitle: Gemini 3.1 Pro is live now.

**SLIDE_2:**
What Happened:
Google released Gemini 3.1 Pro.
It scores 77% on ARC-AGI-2.
That is double the last version.
Available to everyone today.

**SLIDE_3:**
Why It Matters:
Better reasoning means AI can
solve harder, real-world problems.
This puts Google ahead in the
race to build smarter AI models.

**SLIDE_4:**
Key Takeaways:
- Reasoning score jumped from 38% to 77%
- Live on Gemini API, Vertex AI, and apps
- Direct challenge to GPT-5 and Claude 4

**CAPTION:**
Google just made its AI twice as smart at reasoning.

Gemini 3.1 Pro is now available to developers and users. It scored 77% on the ARC-AGI-2 reasoning test, doubling its predecessor. This is one of the biggest AI upgrades of 2026.

Is reasoning the skill that matters most for AI right now?

## POST 2: Meta $135B AI Investment

**POST_TITLE:** Meta $135 Billion AI Bet

**SLIDE_1:**
Headline: Meta Will Spend $135B on AI This Year
Subtitle: The largest AI investment in history.

**SLIDE_2:**
What Happened:
Meta announced $135 billion in AI spending.
They are building 30 new data centers.
Nvidia will supply next-gen GPUs.
Privacy computing comes to WhatsApp.

**SLIDE_3:**
Why It Matters:
This is not just software investment.
Meta is building the physical backbone
for a new kind of computing.
AI is becoming infrastructure, not just tools.

**SLIDE_4:**
What's Next:
Meta is chasing "personal superintelligence."
Expect AI that deeply understands each user
across all Meta platforms by late 2026.

**CAPTION:**
Meta just committed $135 billion to AI in a single year.

That buys 30 data centers, Nvidia's latest chips, and privacy-focused AI on WhatsApp. Mark Zuckerberg calls it the path to personal superintelligence. No company has ever spent this much on AI.

Is this the right bet, or is it too much too fast?

## POST 3: Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6

**POST_TITLE:** Claude Can Now Find Code Bugs

**SLIDE_1:**
Headline: Claude Now Catches Bugs Your Tests Miss
Subtitle: Anthropic launches Claude Code Security.

**SLIDE_2:**
What Happened:
Anthropic released Claude Sonnet 4.6.
It includes a new Code Security tool.
It finds logic errors, not just typos.
These are the bugs that slip into production.

**SLIDE_3:**
Why It Matters:
Logic bugs are the most expensive to fix.
They pass tests and only break in real use.
An AI that catches them early could save
companies millions in debugging costs.

**CAPTION:**
Anthropic's Claude doesn't just write code anymore. It audits it.

Claude Sonnet 4.6 ships with a new Code Security tool that catches logic errors — the kind your tests miss. These are the bugs that cost the most to fix and do the most damage.

Would you trust AI to review your code before it ships?

## POST 4: AI2 Theorizer

**POST_TITLE:** AI That Writes Scientific Theories

**SLIDE_1:**
Headline: This AI Reads Research and Writes Theories
Subtitle: Meet Theorizer by the Allen Institute.

**SLIDE_2:**
What Happened:
AI2 built an AI called Theorizer.
It reads academic papers at scale.
Then it writes testable scientific theories.
It achieved high precision in benchmarks.

**SLIDE_3:**
Why It Matters:
Researchers spend years reviewing literature.
This tool compresses that into hours.
It can spot patterns across thousands of papers
that humans would never connect.

**CAPTION:**
An AI just read thousands of research papers and wrote testable scientific theories.

The Allen Institute's Theorizer synthesizes knowledge across entire fields of research. It could transform how we discover new medicines, materials, and energy solutions. Years of work, compressed into hours.

Which science field will AI change first?
